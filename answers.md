I do notice a pattern, namely that the Huffman cost is more work efficient than the fixed length cost in every file the code was run on. The average ratio of huffman cost: fixed length cost is abour 0.67/0.68, which shows a large improvement over the fixed length cost, especially with text files with lots of characters such as 'alice29.txt' and 'asyoulik.txt.'
File | Fixed-Length Coding | Huffman Coding | Huffman vs. Fixed-Length
----------------------------------------------------------------------
f1.txt    |                     |                |
alice29.txt    |                     |                |
asyoulik.txt    |                     |                |
grammar.lsp    |                     |                |
fields.c    |                     |                |
